# _endemic_ - examples and related studies

[endemic](...) aims to be a multifuntional software package to allow the simulation and stidy of various forms of propagation processes on a multitude of structures.

In this folder you find examples that illustrate particular use cases.
Most of the here present examples are related to published scientific work but this is not a necessary condition. 
Also, for some examples a particular version (mabye even a particular branch) of [endemicpy](...) is required.
An example might fail or produce inconsistent data if run with the wrong version.
What version or branch is needed by an exemplary use case is always specified in the related README file.

Note also hat the present examples do not completely span the range of applicaiton of the [endemic](...) package and that the package is currently used in other projects and thus under continuous development.

## Studies:

- **[Short-term activity cycles impede information transmission in ant colonies](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005527)** studies information propagation on ant colonies.
    Have a look at [ant_colony/](./ant_colony/) for further details on the use of endemic in this study.
